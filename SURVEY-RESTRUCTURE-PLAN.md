**JavaScript Logic:**

```javascript
function toggleOption(option, isNoneOption = false) {
    if (isNoneOption) {
        // If "None" is clicked, deselect all others
        if (option.selected) {
            selectedOptions.forEach(opt => {
                if (opt !== option) opt.selected = false;
            });
        }
    } else {
        // If any other option is clicked, deselect "None"
        const noneOption = findOption("None of these");
        if (noneOption) noneOption.selected = false;
    }
}
```

**Apply to all multi-select questions with "None" option:**
- Reasons not purchased
- What would make you buy
- Current food solutions
